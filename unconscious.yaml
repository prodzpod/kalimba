## Collective Unconscious

## Config
# Configurated for RPGMaker 2k3.
# - No chords support: arpeggiates them instead
# - Octave change keys: smart octaves active
# - Can only press 1 key every frame: 1/60

_idle_delay: 1 # ticks to rest between each checks 
_busy_delay: 1 # tick to wait before pressing next note (arpeggio, set to 0 to play multiple notes at the same time)
_release_duration: 1 # ticks to wait before releasing the note (set to 0 to press until you release the key)
_smart_octave: true # if true, all but last note will be treated as octave and not be pressed multiple times.
_panic_threshold_notes: 6 # number of queued notes to panic and skip processing. this is important for cases where there are too many notes and the thing is overloaded.

## Notes
# you can directly instruct MIDI operation, all messages look like "903C2100", it gets fed into regex:
# midi_^903C: A, 1 # (will match for every midi message starting with "903C") (play C)

# or alternatively, you can press or release with note names, with release marked as ^[note] (ahk notation):
# press_C5: [, left
# release_C5: ^[, ^left

# you can also define press and release at the same time with toggle_
# toggle_C5: [, left # does the same thing as above

# you can also define meta notes:
# press_C#: 2
# release_5: ^left

# key press order: [META_OCTAVE] [META_NOTE] [SPECIFIC_NOTE] [MIDI]
